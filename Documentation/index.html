                        <p>
                            <strong>Question 1: Do I need a VPS OR a Dedicated server to run this platform ? 
                            </strong><br>

                            <strong class="text-success">Answer:</strong>
                           No, this platform will function properly even if you run it on a shared host. However, you might need to update your server or hosting if you receive a lot of traffic. To guarantee optimal performance, our programs are extensively optimized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Question 2: Which hosting provider should I choose for this? Do you have any
                                suggestions ? </strong><br>
                            <strong class="text-success">Answer:</strong> Any hosting company that offers cPanel-based hosting is an option for you. Although it is not required, we advise you to choose hosting that is based on cPanel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Question 3: I don't have cPanel, What should I do? </strong><br>
                            <strong class="text-success">Answer:</strong> Don't worry; our system may be used with any control panel. However, because cPanel is simple to use, we suggest hosting that is based on it. Additionally, our free support is only available for hosting that uses cPanel.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Question 4: If I failed to install Do you support installing? </strong><br>
